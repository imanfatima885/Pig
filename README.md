# Pig Game 🐷

A simple Python implementation of the classic dice game **Pig**, where 2–4 players take turns rolling a die to reach a score of 50.
Players must decide whether to roll again and risk losing their turn’s points or hold and keep their score.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Each player takes turns rolling a 6-sided die.
- If you roll a **1**, your turn ends and you lose all points from that turn.
- If you roll **2–6**, the value is added to your turn's score.
- You can choose to "hold" and add your turn score to your total.
- The first player to reach **50 points** wins!


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

Have fun and don’t be a pig! 🐖
